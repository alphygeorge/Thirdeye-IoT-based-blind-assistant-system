# Thirdeye: Connecting The Dots of Unseen World
Blind and visually impaired people have encountered a lot of challenges when performing
most of the natural activities performed by non-disabled people. In particular, many
dangerous situations occur in environments that are unfamiliar to them. This IoT project
aims to enhance the mobility and independence of visually impaired individuals by developing
a wearable device that can be attached to their spectacles. The proposed system
uses IoT technologies to create a comprehensive environment perception and navigation
aid, assisting blind individuals in recognizing and interacting with their surroundings
more effectively. The device leverages Arduino technology and is seamlessly connected to
a mobile phone. Its primary functionality is to detect objects in the userâ€™s vicinity and
provide real-time audio cues to assist with navigation and obstacle avoidance. The system
utilizes ultrasonic or infrared sensors to continuously scan the surroundings, measuring
distances to nearby objects. The Arduino microcontroller processes this data and communicates
wirelessly with a mobile phone application. The project emphasizes user-friendly
design and accessibility, ensuring that visually impaired individuals can easily configure
and use the device. Through this innovative IoT solution, visually impaired individuals
gain increased awareness of their surroundings, improving their ability to navigate independently
and with confidence. This project demonstrates the potential of IoT and
Arduino technology to address real-world challenges and enhance the quality of life for
individuals with visual impairments.
